                <p>The Python Calculator project is a simple yet functional application built using Python and the Tkinter library for graphical user interface (GUI) development.
                    This project serves as a practical implementation of core programming concepts learned during my coding journey,<br />particularly during the first 35 days of the #100DaysOfCode challenge.
                    The calculator is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, providing a user-friendly experience.
                    The calculator has a clean and intuitive GUI that allows users to interact with it effortlessly. Buttons are clearly labeled, making it easy for users to perform calculations without confusion.</p>

                <p>Python Snake Game – A modern recreation of the classic snake game,
                    built using Python's Turtle Graphics.
                    This project features smooth snake movement, dynamic food mechanics,
                    real-time scoring, and high-score tracking stored locally.
                    This is a modern, fun take on the classic arcade game we all know and love. Built using Python's Turtle Graphics,
                    the game features smooth controls, colorful food mechanics, and a high-score tracking system.
                    Up Arrow: Move up Down Arrow: Move down Left Arrow: Move left Right Arrow: Move right Objective: Guide the snake to eat food, grow longer, and achieve the highest score possible.</p>

                <p>This String class is a custom implementation of a string-like object in C++ designed to mimic the behavior of std::string while providing complete control over dynamic memory management.
                    By manually handling memory allocation, copying, and deallocation, the class demonstrates key concepts of object-oriented programming, including encapsulation, operator overloading,
                    deep copying, move semantics, and resource management (also known as RAII—Resource Acquisition Is Initialization). It offers a range of features that are often required for efficient string manipulation,
                    including concatenation, comparison, and stream operations.
                    It includes features such as deep copying, move semantics, concatenation, comparison, and stream operations, among others.</p>

                <p>My Countdown Timer App : 
                    Made with Python & Tkinter I created a Countdown Timer using Python’s Tkinter library! This app lets me input time in minutes, start the timer, and watch as it counts down to zero.
                    When the timer finishes, a check mark appears to signal that time’s up. This app combines interactive elements, a clean UI, and practical timer logic.
                    The Countdown Timer lets me input time in minutes, start the countdown, and displays a check mark when time’s up. With a focus on user-friendly design,
                    I incorporated color consistency (gray, red, and orange) and a bold Courier font for a clean, appealing interface.</p>
